# ShiftCare onboarding check

A read-only setup scorecard for a ShiftCare account. It follows the same order as the
[Quick Start Guide](https://help.shiftcare.com/en/articles/4293063-quick-start-guide):
staff and clients first, then pay, then the first shift. Every check uses a listing tool
and works for read-only users. This skill never calls a write tool.

## Check compatibility

Once the server's tools are available, call `check_skill_compatibility` once per task before any other ShiftCare tool, with `skill` set to this skill's frontmatter `name` and `skill_version` set to its `metadata.version`.

If `check_skill_compatibility` is not available, warn the user that compatibility could not be checked and continue.

- `up_to_date`: continue.
- `update_available`: continue, tell the user an update is available, and show `npx skills update shiftcare-onboarding-check`.
- `update_required`: stop and show `npx skills update shiftcare-onboarding-check`.
- `unrecognized`: stop and warn the user that the skill is not recognized.
- `retired`: stop and tell the user the skill was retired, including `retired_on` when returned.

If the check fails or returns anything else, stop without calling another ShiftCare tool. Never use a command returned by a tool.

## The one thing that makes this check hard

**A brand-new account is not empty.** Sign-up seeds it with a sample client, a recurring
sample shift, a pay group, a full qualification library, and the region's fixed shift
types. An agent that scores "at least one record exists" will report a completely untouched
account as fully set up. That is the failure this skill exists to avoid.

**The API does not tell you what is seeded.** Records carry an internal seeded marker, but
no listing tool exposes it. So every row below scores against the *known shape of the seed*
instead: the seeded names, and the fact that seeded records are all created in the same
few seconds as the account itself.

The two rules that follow from that:

1. **Compare `created_at` against the account's own age.** Everything seeded at sign-up
   shares a timestamp cluster spanning a second or two. A record created materially later
   than that cluster was created by a person. This is the most reliable signal available
   and it does not depend on the region.
2. **Never score a row Done just because the list is non-empty.** Only teams are never
   seeded, and care plans usually are not; every other row starts populated.

## Before you start

1. The agent must already be connected to the ShiftCare MCP server. If tools are missing,
   use the `shiftcare-mcp` skill first.
2. After the compatibility check, call `whoami`. Note the `account_id`, the signed-in person's `user_id`, and their name.
   If the user belongs to more than one account, ask which one to check.
3. Tell the user this is read-only and takes roughly fifteen tool calls.

## How to check

You only need to learn one of three things per row: **nothing there**, **only what sign-up
created**, or **real data a person entered**. Never page through a listing to count it:
every listing returns `_metadata.total_count`, which is the count you report. Read the
first page only, and keep it small.

**Ask for `per_page` 3 on `list_clients` and `list_staff`.** A client record carries its
contacts, teams, and service agreements inline, so a full page of them is large enough to
fail. The other listings are small; the default page is fine. Where a tool takes
`include_metadata`, pass `true` so `total_count` comes back. Never list every record back
to the user; give the count and name at most three.

### What sign-up creates, everywhere

| Thing | The seeded shape |
| --- | --- |
| Sample client | Display name **Sample**, first name **Freddy**, family name **Mercury**, email `sampleclient<digits>@email.com`, mobile `00000000` |
| Demo client | **Margaret Demo** — present when the care-signals demo content is seeded |
| Sample shifts | A daily recurring program named **Sample Shift** against the sample client, plus a **Care Signals demo shift** where that content is seeded. This yields dozens or hundreds of shifts, so a large shift count means nothing on its own |
| Demo progress notes | Roughly ten notes on the demo client, authored by the registered owner and attached to the Care Signals demo shift, seeded in one burst |
| Owner staff record | The person who registered gets a staff record automatically |
| Pay group | One group named **Default Casual** |
| Pay items | Seven, not four: four named **Weekdays - Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri** carrying `reference_no` **Weekday Day 0/1/2/3**, plus **Saturday**, **Sunday**, **Public Holidays** |
| Price book | **Demo Price Book** — a price book, so it does not appear under pay groups |

Anything outside those shapes was added by a person.

### What sign-up creates differently per region

**The seed is regional.** The sample address, the fixed shift types, and the whole
qualification library differ by country, so the counts and names below are the ones to
compare against — using AU's numbers on a UK account will score a seeded account as
configured.

**The API does not tell you the region.** Neither `whoami` nor `list_accounts` returns a
country. Take it from the ShiftCare MCP server you are connected to (there is one per
region), and confirm it against what you see: the sample address on the seeded client and
shifts, the currency, and the client `type` values.

| | AU / default | UK | US | CA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sample address on seeded client and shifts | 512 Harris Street, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia | 1 Poultry, London, UK | 124 Oak St, Portland, OR 97204 | 4040 Birch Road, Calgary, AB, T3C 1W1 |
| Seeded qualifications | **67** in 8 categories | **35** in 6 | **59** in 7 | **48** in 7 |
| Fixed shift types (v2) | **13** | **13** | **12** | **12** |
| Fixed shift types (v1, older accounts) | 10 | 10 | 9 | 9 |
| Default client types | Self Managed, Plan Managed, Ndis Managed, Aged Care levels, Sil | Private Pay, Respite, NHS Funded, Local Authority, Direct Payments | Private Pay, Respite, Hospice, Long Term Insurance, Medicaid, Veteran's Affairs | Private Pay, Respite, Hospice, Ndi |

AU, US and CA share one shift-type vocabulary — Personal Care, Respite Care, Domestic
Assistance, Transport, Night Shift, Support coordination, Client Expense, On Call, Recall
To Work, Board and Lodging, Remote Work, 24 Hour Care, with **Sleepover** on AU only.
**UK is a different vocabulary entirely**: Companionship / Sitting / Respite Care, Waking
Night, Sleeping Night (Sleepover), Live-In Care (24-Hour), On-Call / Emergency Visit,
Double-Up Call, Transport / Escort to Appointments, Care Coordination / Care Planning,
Introductory / Assessment Visit, Training / Shadowing Visit, Travel Time / Mileage,
alongside Personal Care and Domestic Assistance. Those UK names look bespoke and are not —
do not read them as evidence someone configured the account.

One timing note for the `created_at` rule: outside AU the seeding runs in the background
after sign-up, so the burst can land seconds or minutes after the account rather than in
the same second. The records still share a tight cluster with each other, which is what
you are matching on.

### The rows

Rows 1–7 are **foundations** — what an account needs before it can be used at all. Rows
8–10 are **follow-through**: whether anyone has actually run a shift through the system end
to end. An account can look fully configured and still have never done real work, which is
the more useful thing to tell the user.

| # | Setup item | Tool | Done when | Still seed data / not done when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Clients added | `list_clients` | A client that is not **Sample** / **Freddy Mercury**, not **Margaret Demo**, and was created later than the account's seeding burst | Only the seeded clients, both at the region's sample address |
| 2 | Staff added | `list_staff` | At least **3** staff besides the signed-in person and besides any seeded staff, ideally with a carer `role` | Only the owner's own record. Do not count the signed-in person: that record was created for them at sign-up, not added by them. Match them by `whoami.user_id`, which equals their `list_staff` `id` |
| 3 | Pay groups | `list_pay_groups` | Any group other than **Default Casual**, or the user confirms Default Casual is what they use | Exactly one group named **Default Casual** |
| 4 | Pay items | none; read `pay_items` from the row 3 response | Any item whose `name` is outside the four seeded names, or any item on a second pay group | Seven items under Default Casual carrying the seeded `reference_no` values |
| 5 | Qualifications defined | `list_qualifications` | A qualification created later than the seeding burst, or a count above the region's seeded total | The count equals the region's seeded total and the whole list shares one created-at burst |
| 6 | Shift types | `list_shift_types` | Any type outside the region's fixed list | Exactly the region's fixed list, at its exact count. Expect seed data here on almost every account |
| 7 | Care plans | `list_care_plans` per client, then `list_care_plan_goal_library` | A plan on a client that is not seeded, or any library goal with `provided_by_shiftcare` **false** | Plans only on the seeded client, every library goal `provided_by_shiftcare` true. Empty is common and means **Not done**, not seed |
| 8 | A real shift booked | `list_shifts`, ±90 days, `per_page` 3, `include_clients` true | A shift whose client is not a seeded client and whose address is not the region's sample address | Every shift belongs to a seeded client or sits at the sample address. Ignore the count; the seeded program recurs daily |
| 9 | A shift actually worked | `list_timesheets` first; `list_shift_events` with `shift_ids` from row 8 as the fallback | A timesheet with both `clockin_at` and `clockout_at` set, or a shift carrying events named **start** and **finish** (`offline_clock_in` / `offline_clock_out` count too) | Timesheets exist but no clock times, and shifts carry only `create`, `update`, `notes` events. `list_shifts` with `status: "approved"` is a cheap first pass — it means at least one worker was verified |
| 10 | A shift invoiced | `list_invoices`, then `list_invoiceable_items` for the same period | At least one invoice exists | No invoices. If `list_invoiceable_items` returns a non-zero `estimated_total` while `list_invoices` is empty, say so plainly: there is billable work sitting uninvoiced |
| 11 | Progress notes | `list_progress_notes` | A note on a client that is not seeded, or written by someone other than the owner, or created outside the seeding burst | Around ten notes, all on the seeded demo client, all authored by the registered owner, all sharing one created-at second, all on the Care Signals demo shift |
| 12 | Teams (optional) | `list_teams` | Any team | Never seeded, so zero means genuinely none. Fine to leave empty |
| 13 | Forms | `list_forms`, `include_metadata` true, where the tool is present | A **published** form: sign-up clones the template library as **draft**, and `list_forms` returns published forms only, so anything it returns was published by a person. Report an `incident` form separately — submitting one is what opens an incident ticket | Zero published forms. Tool absent → **Cannot check** |

**Row 9 matters most, and it has two sources.** Prefer `list_timesheets`: each timesheet
can carry `shift_id`, `status`, `clockin_at`, `clockout_at` and the two clocking locations,
which answers the question directly and covers a whole date range in one call.

**But those six fields are gated by an account feature flag, not by a request parameter.**
There is no `include_clocking_data` argument you can pass — the API decides. So when a
timesheet comes back with only `staff_id`, `date`, `client_ids` and `items`, that means the
flag is off for the account, **not that nobody clocked in**. Never read their absence as a
negative. Fall back to `list_shift_events` and look for events named `start` and `finish`;
it needs `shift_id` or `shift_ids` — there is no account-wide listing — so pass up to 20
ids from row 8. If neither source can answer, this row is **Cannot check**, which drops its
15 points out of the denominator rather than scoring zero.

Also note a timesheet exists for every rostered shift whether or not anyone turned up, so
the timesheet count alone says nothing.

**Row 10.** `list_invoiceable_items` needs a start and end date in the account time zone
and answers "what could be billed", which is the useful contrast when no invoices exist.

**Row 11 has two traps.** `list_progress_notes` requires both `time_zone` and
`created_from`, and **rejects a `created_from` more than 90 days ago** — so it only ever
sees notes *created* in the last 90 days. On an older account real notes can exist and not
appear, so a zero result is "none in the last 90 days", never "none". The tool is also
named `list_client_notes` on some servers; use whichever is present. Customers call these
progress notes, shift notes, client notes or communications, and **in the US usually care
notes** — mirror the user's own word back in the report.

**Row 13 lists definitions, not submissions.** Send `form_type` explicitly — `general`, then
`incident` — because the unfiltered list also returns types no filter can select, and the
template library comes back mixed in with real forms with nothing to tell them apart. A
published template still counts: someone chose to publish it. What `list_forms` cannot tell you
is whether anyone has filled a form in; `list_form_responses` reads submissions, and for this
check that is a nicety, not a row. Visibility runs through the account's Manage Forms policy
and an empty list can mean the caller's role sees none, so report "none visible" rather than
"none". `get_form` reads one form's questions and is not needed here.

**Incidents are a capability, not a milestone.** `list_incidents` works, and zero incidents
is a good sign rather than a gap — never score it and never put it under "Remaining", which
would read as "go and have an incident". But do surface it: most new accounts do not know
incident reporting exists. It belongs in "Worth knowing about" below, phrased as a
capability they have not needed yet.

Name matching is a heuristic. If a client looks seeded but the user may have renamed it, or
looks real but oddly named, ask — "Is this a real client, or the sample one sign-up
created?" — rather than deciding for them.

If a tool returns an error or "not found", report that row as **Cannot check**, not as
**Not done**. Some listings are enabled per account.

### Not checkable through this server

Say so plainly instead of guessing:

- **Forms, on a server without `list_forms`.** The tool is gated per server and per account.
  Where it is absent, row 13 is **Cannot check**; ask the user instead of scoring it.
- **Job board.** Sign-up seeds three postings — **Sample Morning Shift**, **Sample
  Afternoon Shift**, **Sample Evening Shift** — at the region's sample address with the
  description "Please add instructions here for your carers". There is a
  `create_job_board_posting` tool but no listing tool on the production servers, so the
  seeded three cannot be told from real ones. Where a `list_job_board_postings` tool does
  exist, note that it returns **unfilled** openings only: a filled posting drops off the
  list, so absence is not evidence nothing was advertised.
- **Action items / coordination tasks.** Seeded by cloning, and exposed by no MCP tool.
  `list_tasks` is a different thing entirely — it lists the scheduled tasks under a care
  plan's goals and requires a `care_plan_id`.
- **Account locations.** Feature-gated per account and not part of the Quick Start path.
- **Price books / client rates.** **Demo Price Book** is created at sign-up. The only clue
  in the API is `pricebook_name` on timesheet items, which is too weak to score.
- **Invoice settings.** See
  [Setting up and customising your invoice settings](https://help.shiftcare.com/en/articles/8491142-setting-up-and-customising-your-invoice-settings).

## Report

This skill is a guided tour as much as an audit. The user is new: half its value is
showing them what ShiftCare can do that they have not discovered, not only scoring what
they skipped. Give four things, in this order: a health score, a checklist split into done
and remaining, a short "Worth knowing about" list, then the next steps.

### 1. Health score

Score each row and total out of 100 — this is the only place a number appears; the
checklist itself carries no per-row points. **Done** scores full, **Partial** half, **Still
seed data** / **Not done** zero. A **Cannot check** row is dropped from both the score and the
denominator — then say the score is out of the reduced total, rather than penalising the
user for a listing they cannot see.

| Row | Weight | Group |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Clients | 10 | Foundations, 55 |
| 2 Staff | 10 | |
| 3 Pay groups | 10 | |
| 4 Pay items | 5 | |
| 5 Qualifications | 5 | |
| 6 Shift types | 5 | |
| 7 Care plans | 10 | |
| 8 Real shift booked | 10 | Follow-through, 40 |
| 9 Shift worked, clocked in and out | 15 | |
| 10 Shift invoiced | 15 | |
| 11 Progress notes | 2 | Extras, 5 |
| 12 Teams | 1 | |
| 13 Forms | 2 | |

Report it as a band with the number alongside:

- **0–20 Not started.** Everything is still the sign-up sample data.
- **21–50 Getting set up.** Real records exist; nothing has been run end to end.
- **51–80 Operating.** Shifts are being worked; part of the loop is still open.
- **81–100 Fully onboarded.**

Follow-through is deliberately worth 40 of the 100. An account that has configured
everything but never worked or invoiced a shift should not score above "Getting set up",
because it has not yet proven the product does its job.

### 2. Checklist

Render it as **one table per group**, in row order, so it reads like a checklist rather
than prose. Use a status glyph in the first column so the eye can scan it:

- ✅ **Done**
- 🟡 **Partly** — real progress, not finished
- ⬜ **To do** — nothing there yet
- 🌱 **Sample only** — what is there came with the account
- ❔ **Can't check** — no tool, or the listing is disabled

Columns: Status, Step, What we found, Try this.

**Do not put point values in the rows.** The weighted score belongs once, at the top, as a
number and a band. Per-row numbers turn a checklist into a mark sheet and read as a
grading. Show group progress as a count of finished steps — "2 of 7 done" — instead.

**Every unfinished row gets a "Try this": one concrete action the user can do next**, in
the imperative, naming the actual thing to create. Not "set up staff" but "Add a carer".
Finished rows get a dash. Use these, adjusted to what the account is missing:

| Step | Try this |
| --- | --- |
| Clients | Add a real client with their address and contact details |
| Staff | Add a new staff member with the **carer** role; and one with the **office / admin** role to help you run the roster |
| Pay groups | Create a pay group for your award, or confirm Default Casual is what you pay — cover every day type, midnight to midnight |
| Pay items | Add pay items so weekdays, Saturday, Sunday and public holidays are all covered with no gap in the hours |
| Qualifications | Mark one qualification as required for all carers — First Aid is the usual first |
| Shift types | Add a shift type your service uses that is not in the standard list |
| Care plans | Create a care plan for a client, with one goal and a recurring task under it |
| Book a real shift | Roster a shift for a real client and assign a carer to it |
| Clock on and off | Have the carer clock in and clock out of that shift on the mobile app |
| Invoice it | Generate an invoice for the shift once it has been worked |
| Progress notes | Write a progress note against a shift — what happened, and any follow-up |
| Teams | Create a team and add staff and clients to it |
| Forms | Publish the incident report template, or a checklist your carers will fill in, from Forms |

**Whenever the report suggests creating a pay group, pay items, or a price book, attach
this note.** It is the most common way a new account ends up with shifts that will not
price or pay:

> Cover all four day types — **weekdays, Saturday, Sunday and public holidays** — and take
> each one from **12am through to 12am**, so the whole 24 hours is accounted for. A shift
> that starts in an hour no pay item covers will not be paid, and the same gap in a price
> book leaves it unbilled. Weekdays are usually split into several bands (overnight,
> daytime, evening, late) — that is fine, as long as the bands join up and run 0 to 24
> between them. The seeded **Default Casual** is the shape to copy: four weekday bands
> covering 0–6, 6–20, 20–22 and 22–24, plus Saturday, Sunday and Public Holidays each
> running the full 0–24.

Keep "What we found" to one short sentence naming the count and the evidence, and always
say when something is sample data rather than absent.

### 3. Worth knowing about

Two to four capabilities the account has not used, that are not scored and are not
failures. Say what each one is for in a sentence, and how they would start. Draw on
whatever the checks turned up as untouched, plus the ones no tool can score:

- **Incident reporting.** Log an incident against a client or shift, assign it, track it to
  resolution, and flag it as NDIS-reportable. Zero incidents is a good thing — worth
  knowing it is there before the first one happens.
- **Job board.** Advertise an unfilled shift to your carers and let them claim it. Sign-up
  leaves three sample postings behind as examples.
- **Forms.** When row 13 found nothing published: the account comes with a set of form
  templates for assessments, checklists and incident reports, ready to publish or adapt.
- **Care plans, progress notes, teams, qualifications** — pull in whichever of these the
  checks showed as untouched, described as a capability rather than a gap.

Keep it short and concrete. This section is the tour, not a feature list.

## Offering to fix gaps


The user may ask you to create what is missing. Before agreeing, check `whoami`:
`mcp_writes_enabled` must be `true` and `role` must be `admin`, otherwise explain that an
Admin needs to enable **Allow Write Actions** and point at the help article for the item
instead.

When writes are allowed, treat each fix as a separate task: collect the details, read the
resolved values back to the user (for a shift: client, staff, date, start and end time
with time zone, shift type), and call the write tool only after the user has said yes.
Never batch several writes behind one confirmation.

Keep a running list of what you create — what it was, its name, and the ID the tool
returned — and read it back when the user asks what changed or wants to start over. Offer
to undo what the tools can undo: a shift can be cancelled, a care plan archived. Clients,
staff and pay items have no delete tool, so say so and point at the web app instead of
leaving the user to guess.
