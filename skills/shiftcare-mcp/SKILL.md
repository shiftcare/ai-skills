# Connect to the ShiftCare MCP server

ShiftCare runs one remote MCP server per region. Once connected, the agent can read the user's rostering, client, staff, and invoicing data, and change it if the account allows write actions.

## Before you start

Confirm these with the user. Each one is a common reason the connection fails later.

1. **MCP is enabled on the account.** An Admin turns it on in ShiftCare under **Account → AI Settings → AI Access → "MCP - External AI Model Access"**.
2. **The user's role.** Admins get full access. Back-office staff (Coordinator, HR, Ops, Support) can connect only if the Admin has enabled **Allow Back Office Access**, and they are read-only no matter what else is enabled.
3. **Write actions.** Off by default. Every tool is read-only until an Admin enables **Allow Write Actions**. Do not promise the user you can create or change records until you have confirmed this.
4. **The account's region.** It matches the domain the user signs in to ShiftCare with.

## Server URLs

| Region | URL |
| --- | --- |
| Australia | `https://mcp.au.shiftcare.com/mcp` |
| United Kingdom | `https://mcp.uk.shiftcare.com/mcp` |
| United States | `https://mcp.us.shiftcare.com/mcp` |
| Canada | `https://mcp.ca.shiftcare.com/mcp` |

Transport is streamable HTTP. Authentication is OAuth through a browser login. There is no API key or token to copy or store.

## Configure the connection

Add the URL for the user's region as a remote HTTP MCP server using the agent's own mechanism for that. Prefer a built-in "add MCP server" command over hand-editing configuration files. Name the server `shiftcare-<region>`, for example `shiftcare-au`.

Never write credentials into a config file, environment variable, or prompt. The login happens in the browser.

ShiftCare publishes step-by-step guides for specific clients. Point the user at the matching one rather than guessing at another client's config format:

## Authenticate

The first tool call opens a ShiftCare login page. The user may be asked to pick their region, then signs in with their normal ShiftCare credentials. The session then persists until it expires. If tools start failing with authentication errors after working before, the session has expired and the user signs in again the same way.

## Verify

1. Check that the server appears in the agent's MCP server list as connected and authenticated.
2. Call the `whoami` tool. It returns the signed-in person and every ShiftCare account they belong to. For each account read:
   - `mcp_available`: the authoritative signal. `true` means tools will work on that account. If `false`, `mcp_unavailable_reason` says why. Do not try other tools until this is `true`.
   - `role`: `admin` can read and, if enabled, write. Any other role is read-only.
   - `mcp_writes_enabled`: `true` only when an Admin has turned on Allow Write Actions. Treat the account as read-only when `false`.
   - `mcp_external_access_enabled`: mirrors the MCP toggle in AI Settings. `false` means an Admin has not enabled MCP for this account.
   - `active_account` is billing information only. Trial accounts show `false` and can still use MCP.
3. If the user belongs to more than one account, ask which one they want to work in.
4. Make one small read-only call, such as listing teams. If it returns data, the connection is working.

Report the result as a table, then say what to do next. Do not bury the read-only answer in a sentence — it is the thing the user most needs to know before asking for anything.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Example Care Co |
| Signed in as | Freddy Mercury (Admin) |
| MCP available | Yes |
| Write actions | Off — read-only |
| Test call | `list_teams` returned 4 teams |

| Priority | Suggested action | Why | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Ask an Admin to enable Allow Write Actions | Every tool is read-only until they do, so nothing can be created or changed | Account → AI Settings |

When everything is already in order, say so in one line and give no suggestions table — an empty table reads as a problem. When the user belongs to several accounts, list them as rows and ask which one to work in rather than choosing for them.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No ShiftCare tools appear | MCP not enabled on the account, or wrong URL | Admin enables MCP in AI Settings; check the region URL |
| Login page rejects the user | Non-Admin and Back Office Access is off | Admin enables Allow Back Office Access, or an Admin connects instead |
| Login succeeds but tools fail | Connected to the wrong region | Match the URL to the domain the user signs in to |
| Write tools are missing or refused | Allow Write Actions is off, or user is not an Admin | Admin enables Allow Write Actions; only Admins can write |
| Tools worked, now return auth errors | Session expired | Sign in again when prompted |

## Tell the user

- The agent sees exactly what the user can see in ShiftCare. Team and role restrictions apply.
- ShiftCare data, including personal and health information, passes through the AI platform. The user's organisation is responsible for meeting its compliance obligations. See the [data handling overview](https://help.shiftcare.com/en/articles/15652546-shiftcare-mcp-server-data-handling-overview).
- Pulling large amounts of data uses a lot of tokens. Ask for what is needed, not everything.
